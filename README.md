# Kristen Liu's Personal Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

My Personal Website is hosted through Github Pages.

I used the following video to help guide me through the process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpI252DmiI. 

## overview:

The website includes a 'home' page, 'about' page, 'experience' page, and 'portfolio' page. The video helped me establish a template and a good starting point for me to further customize and expand on. I decided to add a new 'experience' page to separate contents for a cleaner read and divide between subjects. I personalized and carefully curated the website's theme by hand-drawing graphics and selecting a color scheme. The website also features a 'sidebar' for site navigation and a 'loader' that appears between pages.

## 'home' page:

I hand-drew a logo featuring just the letter "k" which animates onto the page. The rest of the large text on the page animates when hovered over with the mouse. Below, contains a 'contact' button that, when clicked, allows emails to be sent directly to my account. To the right, added a graphic I drew for an aesthetic touch.

## 'about' page:

The title animates when hovered over, similar to the large text on the home page. The main section animates into some text about me, and below it, several images that I selected.

## 'experience' page:

The title and text of this page are similar to the about page. To the right of the text, there is a spinning cube animation.

## 'portfolio' page:

This section includes various projects and a link to their respective GitHub repositories. I hand-drew each of the images, which animate when hovered over, providing a clear view of the selection. 


## 'sidebar':

The sidebar features a hand-drawn graphic of my initials "kl", which leads to the home page. Below, are icons that go to each of the pages mentioned above. At the bottom, the two icons link to my LinkedIn and GitHub account, respectively.
