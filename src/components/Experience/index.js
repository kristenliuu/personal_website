                        At Northeastern University, I have completed the following relevant courses:
                        Machine Learning and Data Mining 1, Object-Oriented Design, Algorithms and Data, Theory of Computation,
                        Computer Systems, Mathematics of Data Models, Database Design, Foundations of Cybersecurity.

                    <p>
                        I completed a co-op/internship as a Data Engineering Co-op at Abiomed, part of Johnson & Johnson MedTech. In this position, I developed comprehensive test scripts to
                        validate the functionality and performance of UI elements and managed test cases, requirements and other documentation. I also
                        enhanced test quality through the implementation of end-to-end testing in Cypress to automate test cases, developed front-end
                        web-based components using Angular, enhancing the user experience and interface design, and collaborated with cross-functional
                        teams to identify, report, and resolve software defects, enhancing the overall product quality.

                        I was a Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course Mathematics of Data Models where I taught and clarified concepts for 400+ students in statistics, linear
                        algebra, and other concepts pertaining to machine learning, evaluated and provided detailed feedback for studentsâ€™ assignments and assessments weekly, and held
                        weekly office hour sessions for one-on-one tutoring to aid students in course material. In the upcoming semester, I will be a Teaching Assistant for the course Machine
                        Learning and Data Mining 1.
